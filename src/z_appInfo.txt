# Challenge 1

Set up React Router for our app. We should be able to do the following:

1. Click on the words "Pic Some" in the header to go to the "/" route, which should display the Photos component (found in the pages folder)

2. Click on the shopping cart icon in the header to go to the "/cart" route, which should display the Cart component (found in the pages folder)

DONEðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€

# Challenge 2

Set up the Context for our app.

1. In a new file, create a new context with React
2. In that same file, create a custom component that renders the Provider of the context you created
3. For now, just pass in an empty string "" as the context provider's value prop
4. Export the custom Provider component and the full context object (so we can pass it to the useContext hook eventually)
5. Set up your index.js to use the custom context Provider you created. (You can wrap it as a parent of the Router component)

DONEðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€

# Challenge 3

Add state to our context and pass it through the Provider

1. Add state to hold the array of all photos our app gets from the API
2. Pass the array of all photos through the value of the provider so it's available anywhere the app accesses the context

DONEðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€

# Challenge 4

Get the JSON data with the photos information from the API and save it to context state

1. As soon as the ContextProvider component renders, get the JSON data from this url: 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bobziroll/scrimba-react-bootcamp-images/master/images.json

2. Save the array of data that comes back to state.

# Challenge 5

Using the data in context state, map over it in the Photos page and display the images.
Get the allPhotos array from context
map over it, creating <Image /> elements of the component we just made
<Image key={???} img={<full image object here>} className={getClass(<index of image>)} />

# Challenge 7

Conditionally render the heart and plus icons when an Image component is being hovered on

1. Icon to render for the heart:
<i className="ri-heart-line favorite"></i>

2. Icon to render for the plus:
<i className="ri-add-circle-line cart"></i>

DONEðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€

# Challenge 8

Add ability to toggle an image's `isFavorited` property by clicking the heart icon (filled heart doesn't need to display on the image yet)

1. Add a toggleFavorite method to context. It should take an `id` parameter and update the array of allPhotos by flipping the `isFavorited` property of the photo with the matching `id`
    a. Have this function also console.log something so we know it's running correctly
    b. Don't try to modify the individual image object only. Make sure to provide a whole new array to context with the one item with the matching `id` being changed.
2. Make it so clicking the heart icon on any given image runs this method

DONEðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€

# Challenge 9 

Make the image display the filled heart icon when it's already favorited

Logic to follow:
* If the image is favorited, display the filled heart icon always
* Otherwise, if the image being hovered on, display the heart outline instead
* If it isn't favorited OR hovered on, don't display anything

Remember to make it so clicking the filled heart icon ALSO runs the toggleFavorite function!

Filled heart icon:
<i className="ri-heart-fill favorite"></i>

DONEðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€

# Challenge 11

Setup context to manage items in an array called `cartItems`. This will be an array of image objects.

1. Add the `cartItems` state to context. (Array)
2. Add function to add an image to the cart. (Takes the full image object as parameter)
3. Make it so clicking the plus icon on the image adds the item to the cart. (Console.log the cart items array to see that it's working)
